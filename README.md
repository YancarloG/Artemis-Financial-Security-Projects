## Artifact: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

### Project Overview
**Objective:** To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's software applications.  
**Key Focus Areas:** Data validation, API security, cryptography, error handling, protection against cross-site scripting (XSS), and safeguarding sensitive data.

### Questions and Answers

1. **Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**
   - Artemis Financial is a financial services organization that places a high value on secure communication both internally and externally. They needed to address potential vulnerabilities in their software to protect sensitive client information, including financial transactions and personal data.

2. **What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**
   - I effectively identified and documented various security vulnerabilities through manual reviews and static testing. Secure coding is crucial as it prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Ensuring software security protects the company's reputation, customer trust, and compliance with regulations.

3. **Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
   - The most challenging part was conducting a thorough manual review of the codebase to identify hidden vulnerabilities. This process was also helpful as it provided in-depth insights into the software's security posture.

4. **How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**
   - I increased layers of security by implementing strong input validation, securing APIs, using robust cryptographic measures, and improving error handling. In the future, I would use automated vulnerability scanning tools, conduct regular security audits, and follow industry best practices to assess and mitigate vulnerabilities.

5. **How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
   - I ensured the functionality and security of the code by performing comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and static analysis. After refactoring, I ran automated security scans and conducted manual reviews to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6. **What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
   - Tools such as dependency-check, static analysis tools, and secure coding libraries were essential. Coding practices like input validation, secure API design, cryptography, and error handling will be beneficial in future assignments.

7. **Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
   - I would showcase the comprehensive vulnerability assessment report, the implementation of secure coding practices, and the detailed mitigation plan. This demonstrates my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities effectively and my commitment to ensuring software security.
